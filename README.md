# Review: Code challenge

## Learning Goals

* Practice writing `if...else if...else` statements.
* Practice working with the ternary operator.
* Nesting a if 
* Prompting a Javascript 


## Introduction 

The code challenge includes three unslove problems whereby chalenge;

1. Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between  0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

2. Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

3. Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 



## Week 1 Toy problems Prerequisites
   ### Prerequisites: 
         
   1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 

   NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution. (i.e `grading.j, salary.js, detector.js and README.md `)

   2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

   3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.


## Configuration
Each of the code challenge contain well written comments whereby helps you to know the arrangment of parts or elements in this challenge i.e the Outiline/ Guideline 


## Instruction 

In the code challenge both the Comparison and Logical Operators are used;
        
   * Comparison Opertors are `if`, `else` and the `else if` 
   * Logial Opeartors are `&&` and `|| `
   
      ### COMPARISON OPERATOR 
      Several statement have been declared in this challenges. (`grading.js , detector.js and  salary.js`) 

      `if statement` is used to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
      `else`is used to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
      `else if` is used to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

      ### LOGICAL OPERATORS 
      Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

      * The `console.log`is simply used to call the function and know if the stated code of the conditions are accurate.
